# Foodpanda-customer-behaviour-analysis
This project focuses on exploring customer behavior by classifying their order patterns, satisfaction and spending behavior using Foodpanda order data. The analysis aims to uncover how customers interact with the platform â€” how frequently they order, what they prefer to eat, how much they spend, and how loyalty or churn relates to their engagement.
